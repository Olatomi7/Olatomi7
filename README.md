# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

_Hi there. I'm Olatomi Smith and I'm a Data Scientist. I have several years of experience in
sales, but transitioned into Data Science early this year. I'm currently studying towards 
obtaining my Masters degree, and also working at a digital repository for research data. You can 
find me reading and watching movies when I am not working, or trying to upskill in Data Science._
